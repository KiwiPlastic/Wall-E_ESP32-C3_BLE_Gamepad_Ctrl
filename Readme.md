Use common Cathod 10mm RGB LED

### Notes: -
    - All moving joints need to be sanded and made to work as smoothly as possible
    - Silicon from (Starlink Installations) is useful on these joints
    - Power up PSU and adjust Bucks to 5v, 6v and 2v BEFORE connecting to main loom
    - Wire up loom and electronics, then test before securing to 3d prints
    - Secure electronics to 3d prints
    - Power up with no Motor or Servo loads, test buttons, leds, oled, MP3 player, xbox controller is working
    - Connect servos and put calibration firmware in ESP32 and perform calibration (https://wired.chillibasket.com/3d-printed-wall-e/)
    - Edit main wall-E firmware to add the calibration values from IDE serial monitor, transfer to ESP32 
    - Power up Wall-E, with game controler off
    - Turn on Game controller, should enrol automatically, watch Oled
    - Test and go for gold
    - Note: Theres no Battery monitor in this code. Use a Li-Po battery monitor/buzzer on Li-Po monitor plug

### Arduino IDE will require these library's
    - BLE-Game_Client by Tomaz bekas V0.12.1
    - ESP_Software_Serial by Dirk Kaar SNDVAPS 8.3.1
    - Adafruit SSD1306 by Adfruit v2.5.17
    - Adafruit PWM Servo Driver lib by Adfruit v 3.03 
    - Adafruit PCF8574 by Adfruit v 1.1.2
    - DFRobotDFPlayerMini by DFRobot v1.0.6
    - Wire.h - I2C library driver, Could be built into IDE Library’s

Note: at time of writting the BLE-Game_Client required a small edit in a txt file to get it working. (https://github.com/tbekas/BLE-Gamepad-Client/pull/122)
It will be fixed in newer version releases, so this edit will not always be required.
